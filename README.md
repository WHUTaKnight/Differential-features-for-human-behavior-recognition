getalt_lab.m  is used to generate differential maps on the LAB color space, by considering color features.

getalt_lgra.m is used to generate differential maps on the L gradient space, by considering gradient features on the L channel.

getalt_agra.m is used to generate differential maps on the A gradient space, by considering gradient features on the A channel.

getalt_bgra.m is used to generate differential maps on the B gradient space, by considering gradient features on the B channel.
